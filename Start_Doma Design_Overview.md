- **Database:**  
  - **PostgreSQL** or **MongoDB** (depending on your data needs) for storing user, project, and product information.
- **Authentication:**  
  - **NextAuth.js** or similar OAuth-based solutions.
- **Storage:**  
  - **Cloud Storage Services:** AWS S3, Firebase Storage, etc., for handling file uploads and media assets.
- **3D Rendering:**  
  - **Three.js:** For interactive 3D visualizations within the platform.
- **Deployment & CI/CD:**  
  - **Vercel:** Ideal for Next.js deployment.
  - **GitHub Actions:** For continuous integration and deployment pipelines.

## 4. Infrastructure Setup

### 4.1 Initial Setup
1. **Repository & Version Control:**  
   - Initialize a Git repository and use a branching strategy (e.g., main, develop, feature branches).
2. **Project Bootstrapping:**  
   - Create a new Next.js project:
     ```bash
     npx create-next-app doma-design-saas
     ```
   - Set up linting (ESLint), formatting (Prettier), and testing (Jest) tools.

### 4.2 Folder Structure
- **/components:** Reusable UI components (e.g., Header, Footer, Sidebar, Cards).
- **/pages:** Next.js pages (public pages, dashboard pages, admin pages).
- **/api:** API routes for server-side logic.
- **/styles:** Global and component-specific styles.
- **/utils:** Utility functions and helper scripts.
- **/public:** Static assets (images, fonts, etc.).

### 4.3 Environment & Configurations
- Set up environment variables (database connections, API keys, etc.) in a `.env.local` file.
- Configure Next.js custom server if advanced backend integration is required.

## 5. Step-by-Step Development Process

### **Step 1: First Layer â€“ Public Website**
- **Design & Wireframe:**  
  - Implement the Public Website Header and Footer using Next.js components.
- **Component Creation:**  
  - Build reusable components (Navigation, CTA buttons) ensuring design consistency.
- **Routing:**  
  - Set up Next.js routing for key pages (Home, Cabinets & Kitchens, How It Works, etc.).
- **Styling:**  
  - Use CSS modules or styled-components for a modular approach.

### **Step 2: Authenticated User Dashboard**
- **Dashboard Layout:**  
  - Create the layout with a sidebar, main content area, and right sidebar.
- **Feature Components:**  
  - Build components for project overview, progress tracking, file uploads, etc.
- **User Authentication:**  
  - Integrate NextAuth.js to manage user sessions and secure dashboard access.

### **Step 3: Administrative Backend**
- **Admin Interfaces:**  
  - Develop management interfaces for customer management, product catalog, and project tracking.
- **API Integration:**  
  - Set up API routes for secure data interactions (CRUD operations, analytics).

### **Step 4: Integrations & Final Touches**
- **Third-Party Services:**  
  - Integrate file storage solutions and 3D rendering capabilities.
- **Performance Optimization:**  
  - Optimize page loading and ensure responsive design.
- **Testing & Deployment:**  
  - Write tests, conduct code reviews, and deploy using CI/CD pipelines.

## 6. Clean Code & Best Practices

- **Modular Architecture:**  
  - Build each component/page as a standalone module for maintainability.
- **Code Reviews & Documentation:**  
  - Regularly review code and document components, APIs, and infrastructure.
- **Consistent Styling:**  
  - Adhere to design guidelines for a cohesive user experience.
- **Incremental Development:**  
  - Start with the foundational Public Website, then incrementally add the User Dashboard and Admin Backend.
- **Refactoring:**  
  - Continuously refactor to improve code structure and performance.
