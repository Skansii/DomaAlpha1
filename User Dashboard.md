The dashboard layout should follow a 3-panel structure for optimal usability:
	1	Left Sidebar Navigation
	2	Main Content Area (Project Overview & Status)
	3	Right Sidebar (Quick Access & Notifications)

This panel provides quick access to all the key sections.

🔹 Dashboard – Home overview of the user’s account.
🔹 My Offers – Displays price offers for kitchen projects.
🔹 3D Renderings – A gallery of their kitchen designs.
🔹 Project Status – Tracks execution progress (Ordered, In Production, Delivery, Installed).
🔹 File Uploads – Allows users to upload scanned plans.
🔹 Help & Support – Quick access to FAQs and contact support.

✅ Design Considerations:
	•	Icons & Labels next to each menu item for clarity.
