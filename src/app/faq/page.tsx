      },
      {
        question: 'Do you require a deposit?',
        answer: 'Yes, all custom orders require a 50% deposit to begin production. The remaining balance is due before shipping or upon delivery. For especially large or complex projects, we may establish a different payment schedule that will be outlined in your contract.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Do you offer financing options?',

      },
      {
        question: 'What happens if I need to cancel my order?',
        answer: 'Order cancellation policies depend on the stage of your order. Cancellations made before production begins are subject to a design and administrative fee, typically 10% of the order total. Once production has started, cancellation fees increase significantly, as materials have been ordered and work has begun. Orders cannot be cancelled once production is complete. All cancellation requests must be submitted in writing.'

        question: 'What warranty do you offer on your cabinets?',
        answer: 'DOMA Design cabinets come with a limited lifetime warranty for residential use, covering defects in material and workmanship under normal use.

      {
        question: 'What is not covered by the warranty?',

Normal wear and tear, color changes due to aging or exposure to light, and slight variations in wood grain or color are also not covered. Additionally, modifications made by unauthorized personnel will void the warranty.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How do I make a warranty claim?',

      },
      {
        question: 'Do you offer extended warranty options?',
        answer: 'For commercial projects or high-traffic residential installations, we do offer extended warranty packages for an additional fee. These plans can extend coverage periods and may include additional services such as annual inspections and maintenance. Contact our sales team for information about extended warranty options for your specific project.'
      },
